# global-covid-19-cases

This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsered Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with two other team members: Angelica Perez and Donovan Crain. We used the p5 javascript library to build a global map that shows the coronavirus cases as of July 27, 2020. If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
